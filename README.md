Neural Network coded from scratch (with exception of numpy)

Inside Attempt2/src you will find the code for the neural network and some examples of its applications. It can be trained on both linear and non linear 2d functions. Additionally, it can be used on more real life applications such as identifying counterfeit bank notes or digit recognition. 
playground0.py trains on 2d functions, playground1.py trains on bank notes, playground2.py trains on handwritten digits.

Banknotes data obtained from Harvard CS50 ai course and digit data (file not included in this repository) obtained from MNIST dataset.
